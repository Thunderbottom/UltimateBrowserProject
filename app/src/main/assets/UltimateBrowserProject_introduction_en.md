UltimateBrowserProject
===

UltimateBrowserProject is a browser that aims to do the work unlike any other browser. Currently, it is in beta and supports the following functions:

### Custom home:

 - When you first log in to the browser, the `about:blank` page is shown.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Add to home__ to pin webpages.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Relayout__ to custom your home.

 - __Long press__ on a card on the home, and you can edit the title.

## Switch tabs:

 - You can set tab switcher position at the __top or bottom of the screen__ at `Setting/Browser/Tab position`.

 - Press the __address bar__ and __drag it down or up__, then the  tab switcher will be displayed.

 - __Swipe up/down__ to dismiss a page.

__Remember__ that if the soft keyboard is shown the tab switcher would not display, it's not a bug, but an intended design.

## Load in background:

 1. Set UltimateBrowserProject as your __default browser__.

 2. __A Single tap__ will open links in background, and show a clickable notification in statusbar.

 3. __Double tapping the link__ will show a dialog that allows you to open links in foreground.

## Volume control:

In `Setting/Browser/Volume control` you can set the volume keys behavior to:

 - Switch tabs.

 - Scroll webpages.

 - System default.

## AdBlock whitelist:

Since AdBlock maybe cause some websites display error, you can add them to `Setting/AdBlock/Whitelist`.

## Readability:

UltimateBrowserProject supports Readability mode but it needs the __Readability API Token__.

To get the token you should go to [Readability Developer APIs](https://www.readability.com/developers/api "Readability Developer APIs") and set it in `Setting/Readability/Token`.


## Screenshot:

UltimateBrowserProject can __capture entire webpages!__ .

But Unfortunately, that doesn't mean you can screenshot a very long page, which may cause the browser to go __Out Of Memory__.


## Log Reporting:

UltimateBrowserProject can automatically capture __Log Reports__ when it crashes.

When the crash takes place, an Alert Dialog will pop up requesting you to send the report. All you have to do is add comments regarding the problem __(OPTIONAL)__, and click OK.
Everything else will be handled by the application itself!
